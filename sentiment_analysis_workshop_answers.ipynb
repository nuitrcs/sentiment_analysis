        "# Sentiment Analysis of Text Data\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Introduction to sentiment analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentiment analysis consists of assigning the label \"positive\", \"negative\" or \"neutral\" to a document based on its overall polarity. For example, this sentence would have a negative sentiment: \"Climate change is terrible. I am really worried.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "While it seems simple, sentiment analysis can be quite complex. For instance, sarcasm is hard to identify. Notice how minor changes to the above sentence would lead a human to understand it differently, while a computer would have a harder time: \"Sure, sure, I get it, climate change is terrible. I am really worried...\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentiment analysis is related to other methods for natural language processing. For example, sentiment analysis is related to the task of assigning a topic to a document (topic modeling). Similarly, sentiment analysis is related to stance detection, but is not exactly the same. Sentiment analysis focuses on the overall tone of a document, while stance detection focuses on the tone of a document regarding a specific entity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Sentiment analysis for research\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentiment analysis can be useful for research with text data, for example, to analyze social media posts, open-ended survey responses, news, and political speeches.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook covers different approaches to sentiment analysis focusing on research applications. Many methods and datasets for sentiment analysis are tailored for industry applications and may not work well off-the-shelf in a research context.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What to expect from this notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook focuses on conveying the idea that there are different approaches to sentiment analysis, give you a sense of what they are and when to consider them, and show you possible basic implementations. However, **each of the approaches has many more details to consider**, which is outside of the scope of this notebook.

        "#### Warning on evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "Given data and time constraints, this notebook does not delve deep into evaluation. **However, regardless of which approach you use for a particular project, it is important to evaluate its performance. Typically, the evaluation requires manually labelling of a sample (which could be a simple random sample, a stratified sample) and comparing against the computational method using [metrics such as accuracy, recall, and precision](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy-precision-recall). Also, as you (probably iteratively) decide on and implement a particular approach, it is important to understand your corpus well, keep in mind your research focus, and quickly see how a given approach seems to be performing. Do not leave evaluation just until the end. Finally, you may want to try different approaches and compare their performance.**\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dictionary or lexicon\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: assign sentiment based on the prevalence of positive vs. negative words contained in a dictionary or lexicon.<br>\n",
        "Pros: transparent, easy to implement, doesn't require labeled data.<br>\n",
        "Cons: doesn't account for how words are used (ambiguity, context, domain-specific connotations, sarcasm, negation), may not identify relevant words or tokens, requires tokenization.<br>\n",
        "Use cases: baseline to compare other approaches, small dataset, too expensive to label data, secondary analysis.<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "There are various common dictionaries used in sentiment analysis. They are designed for different use cases and can vary in size and complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, the [VADER](https://doi.org/10.1609/icwsm.v8i1.14550) lexicon is designed for short, informal documents such as social media posts or open-ended survey responses. VADER uses a crowdsourced vocabulary of over 7,500 terms including slang, emojis, and unconventional spelling. Further, VADER uses an algorithmic approach that doesn't rely solely on word counts, but follow algorithmic rules. For instance, exclamation marks and all caps serve as multipliers and intensifying adjectives and adverbs can also increase the sentiment of the term that they modify. Finally, VADER evaluates terms in local-window contexts of three words to capture negations and flip sentiment polarity accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another example is [Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary (LSD)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2012.671234), which is designed to measure sentiment in political texts by including terms specific to political discourse that do not exist in other lexicons.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this notebook, we're going to use the [VADER dictionary](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.vader.html#module-nltk.sentiment.vader) from the [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) library.
